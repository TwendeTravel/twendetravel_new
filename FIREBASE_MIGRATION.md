# Twende Travel - Firebase Migration

This application has been successfully migrated from Supabase to Firebase for production use.

## üî• Firebase Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable the following Firebase services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password, Google)
   - Firestore Database
   - Cloud Storage
   - Cloud Functions (optional)

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy `.env.local.template` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your Firebase configuration values from the Firebase Console:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Development settings (optional - for local development with emulators)
VITE_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR=false
VITE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost

# Other APIs
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
```

### Firestore Database Setup

The application uses the following Firestore collections:

- `users` - User profiles and authentication data
- `conversations` - Chat conversations between users and admins
- `messages` - Individual chat messages
- `trips` - User trip information
- `destinations` - Available travel destinations
- `bookings` - Travel bookings
- `experiences` - Travel experiences and activities
- `reviews` - User reviews for destinations/experiences
- `itineraries` - Travel itineraries
- `flightSearches` - Flight search history
- `airportCache` - Cached airport data
- `savedDestinations` - User's saved destinations
- `serviceRequests` - Support and service requests
- `userPermissions` - User role permissions
- `notifications` - User notifications
- `auditLogs` - System audit logs

### Security Rules

Set up Firestore security rules to protect your data:

```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Users can read/write their own conversations
    match /conversations/{conversationId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.travelerId == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.adminId == request.auth.uid);
    }
    
    // Users can read/write messages for their conversations
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      // Add more specific rules based on conversation access
    }
    
    // Add more rules for other collections as needed
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Development

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Firebase Emulators (Optional)

For local development, you can use Firebase emulators:

1. Install Firebase CLI:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. Login to Firebase:
```bash
firebase login
```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project:
```bash
firebase init
```

4. Start emulators:
```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

5. Set `VITE_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR=true` in your `.env.local`

## ÔøΩ Current Status - MIGRATION IN PROGRESS

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Ready for Use:**
- [x] Firebase infrastructure setup
- [x] Core authentication system (Firebase Auth)
- [x] User management and roles
- [x] Core services (conversations, messages, destinations, trips, bookings, reviews, experiences)
- [x] Firestore service layer with type safety
- [x] Environment configuration
- [x] Build system compatibility

### üîÑ **IN PROGRESS - Requires Component Updates:**
- [ ] Page components (Dashboard, Chat, Admin pages)
- [ ] React components (ChatWindow, UpcomingTrips, etc.)
- [ ] Service request management
- [ ] User statistics and analytics
- [ ] Admin assignment system

### üìã **What Works Right Now:**
1. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth is fully functional
2. **Database**: All core services use Firestore
3. **Real-time**: Firestore listeners for chat and updates
4. **Build System**: Project builds successfully
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

### üìã **What Needs Migration:**
See `COMPONENT_MIGRATION.md` for detailed list of files that still reference the old Supabase client.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

### Firebase Services Used
- **Firebase Auth**: User authentication and management
- **Firestore**: NoSQL document database for all app data
- **Cloud Storage**: File and media storage (if needed)
- **Cloud Functions**: Server-side logic (if needed)

### Key Files
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase configuration and initialization
- `src/lib/firebase-types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for Firestore documents
- `src/lib/firestore-service.ts` - Generic Firestore CRUD service
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context using Firebase Auth
- `src/services/` - All service files migrated to use Firebase

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Firestore Security Rules**: Implement proper security rules for data access
2. **Authentication**: Ensure proper user authentication and authorization
3. **API Keys**: Keep Firebase configuration keys secure (they can be public for web apps)
4. **Data Validation**: Implement client and server-side data validation

## üìä Performance Optimization

1. **Firestore Indexes**: Create composite indexes for complex queries
2. **Pagination**: Use Firestore pagination for large datasets
3. **Caching**: Implement proper caching strategies for frequently accessed data
4. **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize bundle size

## üö® Known Issues

1. Some components may still have references to old Supabase services - these need to be updated
2. Type mismatches may occur during the transition - check TypeScript errors
3. Real-time subscriptions may need fine-tuning for optimal performance

## üìû Support

For issues related to the Firebase migration, check:
1. Firebase Console for service status
2. Browser console for client-side errors
3. Firebase Functions logs for server-side issues
4. Network tab for API call failures

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Test all application features thoroughly
2. Update remaining components to use Firebase services
3. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
4. Set up monitoring and analytics
5. Configure proper backup and security policies
6. Deploy to production environment
